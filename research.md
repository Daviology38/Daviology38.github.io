_Clustering Analysis of Autumn Weather Regimes in the Northeast U.S._ 
- Funded by NASA NESSF Grant NNX15AN91H S03, NOAA NA20OAR4310424, and NSF AGS-1623912
- Supervisor: Dr. Mathew Barlow
-Identified typical autumn circulation patterns across the Northeast U.S. using a k-means clustering algorithm coded in MATLAB.
-Analyzed seasonality of the circulation patterns, confirming previous observations from other studies that summer is lasting longer in the year and winter starting later.
Project: “Analyzing the Role of Integrated Vapor Transport and Diabatic Heating on Extreme Precipitation Events in the Northeast U.S.” - Funded by NOAA NA20OAR4310424, and NSF AGS-1623912
Supervisor: Dr. Mathew Barlow
Modelled 20 extreme-precipitation events in the Northeast U.S. using the WRF-ARW that were associated with Warm Conveyor Belts and Moisture Transport.
Configured WRF-ARW to run with and without diabatic heating terms using a two-way nested model of resolutions 27km and 3km.
Coded python scripts to plot and analyze the output, determining that diabatic heating played a significant role in Integrated Vapor Transport, its absence causing weakening of extreme precipitation events, with some events not producing enough precipitation to cross the threshold of extreme precipitation.  
Project: “Spring Season Circulation Evolution and Relation to Extreme Events in the Northeast U.S.” - Funded by NASA NESSF Grant NNX15AN91H S03, NOAA NA20OAR4310424, and NSF AGS-1623912
Supervisor: Dr. Mathew Barlow
Identified spring season circulation patterns using K-means clustering and performed analysis on seasonal evolution using them.
Enhanced understanding of extreme Precipitation, Heat wave, and Drought events during the spring season in the Northeast U.S. by investigating their relation to the underlying seasonal circulation patterns.

Project: “A Climatology of Snow Squalls in Southern New England 1994 - 2018”
Supervisor: Dr. Frank Colby
Coded FORTRAN and Python scripts to download METAR station data and determine dates, times, and locations of snow squall events based on given observations. Created a dataset of NEXRAD files for the dates and times of squalls based on proximity to radar sites KBOX and KENX.
Reconfigured existing Python script (TINT) for cell tracking to work with the NEXRAD dataset of snow squall events and output the average direction of cell movement as both a .csv file and plotted on a radial plot of cardinal directions.
Snow squalls were grouped based on average direction of movement, resulting in 4 main types of squalls that varied in orientation and direction of movement based on associated fronts and available convection (either or both CAPE and slantwise).
